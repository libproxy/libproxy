{{{
Hello everyone!

I would like to announce the release of version $VERSION of libproxy, an
open-source library that provides functions to manage proxy
configurations uniformly across applications and user sessions.
libproxy has a stable API and modules to read configuration from
GNOME, KDE, a file, or an environment variable (for compatibility with
existing implementations). In addition, libproxy automatically adjusts
for changing network topology via integration with NetworkManager and
is able to autodetect proxy settings through WPAD and PAC compliance.

Through these features, an application that links to libproxy will not
have to worry about proxy configuration or even a change of networks:
libproxy will automatically provide the correct proxy to use.

Please have a look at http://libproxy.googlecode.com for more info. A
bug requesting libproxy adoption has also been filed:
$BUG_URL

Thanks for your time!
$NAME
